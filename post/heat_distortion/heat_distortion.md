> A tutorial on how to use fragment shaders in WebGL to create an animated heat haze distortion effect on images and text.

Today we want to show you how to create some realistic looking heat haze distortion effects using fragment shaders in WebGL. The idea is to add a subtle animated distortion to a static image and some text.

> **Attention**: The demos use some modern web technology that might not work in older browsers.

**Please note that the current ZIP file is the compiled build of this project; source files and GitHub link are coming soon! Stay tuned.**
