## [原創] How to draw in JavaScript? [Back](./../post.md)

Since my company has given me a requirement of drawing in a browser programmatically, I would like to share some points with you about drawing in JavaScript. Actually, what we're going to draw? **Any picture**.

Note that this is a project which belongs to my company, and that's why I'm not going to *open* the source code in the public community.

At the beginning of the project, I was actually inspired by the animation of glowing line drawing in [this article](./../../Programming/JavaScript/webgl/canvas/line_drawing/line_drawing.md). Before we draw any pictures, what we should know is data of paths. With such data, we are able to simulate the drawing.
