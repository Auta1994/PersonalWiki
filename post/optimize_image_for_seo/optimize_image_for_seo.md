> If you are for instance a blogger or write articles for an online magazine or newspaper, you encounter this question on a probably daily basis: should I add an image to my article? The answer is “Yes”. Images make an article more vivid and can actually contribute to improving the SEO for your article. In this post, I’d like to explain the steps that should be taken to fully optimize an image for SEO.

When optimizing an image you make sure it as small as it can be in terms of download size by using the right image compression. A well-optimized image also has the right name and alt text, so it’s optimized for search engines too.

### Use images

Images, when added with a certain consideration, will help understand your article a lot. “A picture is worth a thousand words”. Yeah, well, probably not for Google, but it can for sure spice up a 1,000 dull words, illustrate what you mean in a chart or data flow diagram, or simply make your social media efforts more attractive.

It’s a simple recommendation: use images to every article you write online. It’ll make it more appealing.

### Finding the right image

<img class="nopadding noborder alignright wp-image-293927 size-full" title="Image of employer welcoming the visitor" src="./not-welcome-to-your-company.jpg" alt="Image SEO: This image isn't saying 'welcome to our&nbsp;company', it's saying 'welcome to a&nbsp;company'.">

If you have the opportunity to add your own image, please do so. Your team page needs pictures of your team, not this dude on the right or one of his stock photo friends. Off topic: let alone that the dude might need a haircut.

Your article needs an image that has the same subject as your article. If you would use an image, just to use an image and get a green bullet in our SEO plugin, you are doing it wrong. The image should reflect the topic of the post, or have illustrative purposes within the article, of course.

There is a simple image SEO reason for that: an image that is surrounded by related text, ranks better for the keyword it is optimized for. More details on image SEO later.

You might have seen the images we are using for our posts (the ones with the titles). We have added these for a number of reasons:

- They emphasize the title or subject of the post
- It’ll trigger a visitor to read the post, as the first view isn’t just text
- These images are used in OpenGraph tags and Twitter Cards, which will add the image to our social shares.

Just another way to go about adding images. By the way, most of these ‘featured images’ are stock photos. We have made them our own by adding the title in the same way over and over, making the actual image subservient to the text in the image. That goes against a much-heard recommendation to not add text in images, but as mentioned, we use that specific image for other purposes, not per se for SEO.

If there is no way to use images of your own, there are other ways to find more unique images and refrain from using stock photos. [Flickr.com](http://flickr.com/) is a nice image source for instance, as explained in this article: [How to Use Creative Commons Images from Flickr](http://www.labnol.org/internet/creative-commons-flickr/18017/). I also like the images provided by sites like [freeimages.com](http://www.freeimages.com/) (formerly known as sxc.hu). Check [here for more image resources](https://designschool.canva.com/blog/free-stock-photos/). You should stay away from the [obvious stock photos](http://peopleimages.com/search#business), and rather pick the ones that look (ok, just a bit) [more genuine](http://www.shutterstock.com/cat.mhtml?searchterm=leisure&language=en&lang=en&search_source=&safesearch=1&version=llv1&media_type=). It almost seems like images with people always look like stock photos, unless taken by yourself. In the end, that is still the best idea.

Obvious alternatives for photos could be illustrations, like we sometimes use, or graphs, of course. An honorable mention should go to [animated GIFs](http://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33560/The-Ultimate-Guide-to-Using-Animated-GIFs-in-Your-Marketing.aspx), as these seem to become more and more popular these days.

<img class="nopadding wp-image-294024 size-full" title="Animated image of Barney Stinson and Robin Scherbatsky from the sitcom How I Met Your Mother doing a highfive." src="./how-i-met-your-highfive.gif" alt="Image SEO: Animated GIFs are popular these days">

Animated GIFs are very popular these days. Don’t go overboard. It’ll make your post less attractive to read, as your reading will be interrupted by the movement in the image, of course. Like in the post [where I found the above image](http://www.emagine.com/b2b-blog/5-things-to-look-at-when-optimizing-your-post-for-seo-gifs/).
