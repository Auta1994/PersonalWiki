## [原創] How to make React components actually reusable [Back](./../post.md)

Recently, I have translated an article written by [Alex Grigoryan](https://medium.com/@lexgrigoryan?source=post_header_lockup), which is mainly to describe how Walmart achieved reusablility with React Components. Due to this translation, I also want to write another article here to summarize how we can actually make this happen.
