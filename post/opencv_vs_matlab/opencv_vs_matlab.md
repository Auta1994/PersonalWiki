We often confuse our tools for our craft. Tools help you practice your craft, but they do not make you a good craftsman. A good craftsman has many different tools in her pocket, and she judiciously uses the one that is appropriate for the job. She is not married to the tools. She is married to her craft.

I am often amused by wars over programming languages. People have very strong opinions about which one is better. The truth is that a programmer should chose the language appropriate for their task. Want to rapidly build a web app ? Try Ruby on Rails or Django. Want to write high performance code for an embedded device. Try C.

In computer vision, we are faced with similar choices. Which tool should a computer vision engineer / programmer learn — OpenCV using C++, OpenCV using Python, or MATLAB ? The good news is that today we have a few options to choose from! A decade back there were no good libraries for computer vision. If you wanted to learn, you just picked up a book and started coding your own mini library of computer vision algorithms. Thankfully, things are much better now.

If you are a beginner, I would suggest using the path of least resistance and picking a tool you are familiar with. If you are a python programmer, use OpenCV with Python. If you know C++, use C++ with OpenCV. The same holds true for MATLAB. That said in a few months you will no longer be a beginner. You may be looking to apply this newly acquired knowledge to the real world. You could be thinking of a new side project, or looking for a new job in this area. It pays ( sometimes literally ) to know how to make your choices. So here are my thoughts.

### MATLAB for Computer Vision

Until recently Computer Vision was a research area in its infancy. People who worked in Computer Vision were mostly in the academia or research labs. Their tool of choice was MATLAB, and for the longest time OpenCV paled in comparison to what MATLAB and its community had to offer. In the last 7 years, the tides have turned. Here are some of the pros of using MATLAB.
