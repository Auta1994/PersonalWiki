## Some problems of building Virtual AGC [Back](./qa.md)

**Virtual AGC (Apollo Guidance Computer)** is used for simulating the real AGC, the DSKY of the real Apollo Guidance System. For personal interest, I have decided to build this [project](https://github.com/aleen42/virtualagc) and know more about Apollo's plan. Here, I will write down some problems of the process with a documenting way.

Here, I just use a **Ubuntu 14.04** to build:

1. Download a development tarball firstly:
    https://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/Downloads/

    Here I would like to build with [**yaAGC-dev-20100220.tar.bz2**](https://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/Downloads/yaAGC-dev-20100220.tar.bz2)
