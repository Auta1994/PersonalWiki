## Protocol Stack   [Back](./../gsm.md)

GSM architecture is a layered model that is designed to allow communications between two different systems. The lower layers assure the services of the upper-layer protocols. Each layer passes suitable notifications to ensure the transmitted data has been formatted, transmitted, and received accurately.

The GMS protocol stacks diagram is shown below:

#### MS Protocols

Based on the interface, the GSM signaling protocol is assembled into three general layers:

- **Layer 1**: The physical layer. It uses the channel structures over the air interface.
- **Layer 2 **
