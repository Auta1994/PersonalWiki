Whatever comments, bugs, enhancements or policy problems you want to contribute to one of my projects, just **open an issue** for me, and make my life easier.

#### Something to do before opening issues

- First of all, checkout the list and find whether anyone else has opened the same issue with yours. If so, just join and give out your words on those issue.

- It's important for you to add the platform and software information after figuring out bugs like **the version of OS, the version of Node** etc. Screen shots are what I wish to ask for, because I would like to see what you have seen before.

- It's suggested to wait for feedback before continuing to next steps. Nevertheless, if the issue is clear and the fix is simple, you can just fix it.

- Make a detailed description about your issue, and make me understood what you want to contribute for my projects.

#### Fixing issues

Fork this project in your account and create a branch with a standard naming convention:

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;**fix-#1-aleen42**

- **#1**: the issue number
- **aleen42**: the user name of your github
