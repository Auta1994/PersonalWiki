Whatever comments, bugs, enhancements or policy problems you want to contribute to one of my projects, just **open an issue** for me, and make my life easier.

#### Something to do before opening

- First of all, checkout the list and find whether anyone else has opened the same issue with yours. If so, just join and give out your words on those issue.
- It's important for you to add the platform and software information after figuring out bugs like **the version of OS, the version of Node** etc. Screen shots are what I wish to ask for, because I would like to see what you have seen before.
