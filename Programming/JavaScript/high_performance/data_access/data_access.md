## Data Access [Back](./../high_performance.md)

Similar to other languages, though, where data is stored can greatly affect how quickly it can be accessed later in JavaScript. There are **4 basic places** which data can be accessed:

- **Literal values**
    
    Any value that represents just itself and is not stored in a particular location. **strings**, **numbers**, **Booleans**, **objects**, **arrays**, **functions**, **regular expressions**, and the special values **null** and **undefeind** can be represented as literal.

- **Variables**

    Any developer-defined location for storing data.
    
- **Array items**

    A numerically indexed location within a JavaScript **Array** object.
    
- **Object members**

    A string-indexed location within a JavaScript object.
