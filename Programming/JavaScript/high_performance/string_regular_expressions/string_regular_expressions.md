## Strings and Regular Expressions [Back](./../high_performance.md)

This chapter mainly helps you understand how regular expression engines internally process strings and teaches you how to write regular expressions that take advantage of this knowledge.

Also in this chapter, we will learn about the fastest cross-browser methods for concatenating and trimming strings, discover how to increase regex performance by reducing backtracking, and any other tips and tricks for efficiently processing strings and regular expressions.

### String Concatenation

String concatenation is a common task for us to build a string, and how to optimize it? For starters, there is more than one way to merge strings

| Method | Example     |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| The `+` operator       | `str = 'a' + 'b' + 'c';`       |
| The `+=` operator       | `str = 'a';`       |
|| `str += 'b';`       |
|| `str += 'c';`       |
|array.join()| `str = ['a', 'b', 'c'].join('');`       |
|string.concat()| `str = 'a';`       |
|| `str = str.concat('b', 'c');`|

All of these methods are fast when concatenating a few strings, nevertheless as the length and number of strings that must be merged increases, some methods start to show their strength.
