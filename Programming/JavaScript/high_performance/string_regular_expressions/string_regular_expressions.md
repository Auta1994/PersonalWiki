## Strings and Regular Expressions [Back](./../high_performance.md)

This chapter mainly helps you understand how regular expression engines internally process strings and teaches you how to write regular expressions that take advantage of this knowledge.

Also in this chapter, we will learn about the fastest cross-browser methods for concatenating and trimming strings, discover how to increase regex performance by reducing backtracking, and any other tips and tricks for efficiently processing strings and regular expressions.

### String Concatenation

String concatenation is a common task for us to build a string, and how to optimize it? For starters, there is more than one way to merge strings

| Method | Example     |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| The `+` operator       | `str = 'a' + 'b' + 'c';`       |
| The `+=` operator       | `str = 'a';`       |
|| `str += 'b';`       |
|| `str += 'c';`       |
|array.join()| `str = ['a', 'b', 'c'].join('');`       |
|string.concat()| `str = 'a';`       |
|| `str = str.concat('b', 'c');`|

All of these methods are fast when concatenating a few strings, nevertheless as the length and number of strings that must be merged increases, some methods start to show their strength.

#### `+` and `+=` Operators

Several techniques maximize the efficiency of these operators.

First, an example.

```js
str += 'one' + 'two';
```

When evaluating this code, four steps are taken:

1. A temporary string is created in memory.
2. The concatenated value "onetwo" is assigned to the temporary string.
3. The temporary string is concatenated with the current value of `str`.
4. The result is assigned to `str`.

But considering the following code, which avoids the temporary string (step 1 and step 2 in the above list), and it will end up running about 10%-40% faster in most browsers:

```js
str += 'one';
str += 'two';
```

In fact, you can get the same performance improvement using one statement like this:

```js
/** equivalent to `str = ((str + 'one') + 'two')` */
str = str + 'one' + 'two';
```

Why? That's because the concatenation is based on the `str` itself, and avoid the temporary string, which will allocate some memory. For this reason, if you assign like this, you'll also lose your improvement:

```js
str = 'one' + str + 'two';
```

Apart from IE, browsers try to expand the memory allocation for the string on the left of an expression and simply copy the second string to the end of it. So, in that browsers, it's recommended not to copy a long string, while there is a short one.

```js
var s1 = 'one';
var s3 = 'three';

/** not `var s = s1 + s3;` */
var s = s3 + s1;
```

These techniques don't apply to IE. They have little, if any, effect in IE8 and can actually make things slower in IE7 and earlier.

In IE8's implementation, concatenating strings merely stores references to the existing string parts that compose the new string, and when you actually use the concatenated string, it starts to copy and replace the previous references so that you can use it anytime.

> IE8'S implementation can throw off synthetic benchmarks, makin concatenation appear faster than it really is, unless you force it to occur.

IE7 has an earlier use an inferior (較次的) implementation of concatenation, in which each pair of concatenated strings must always be copied to a new memory location. Then, considering `largeStr = largeStr + s1 + s2;`, the variable `largeStr` will be copied twice in this case. Conversely, `largeStr += s1 + s2;` will be faster because IE7 and earlier browsers will firstly concatenate two small string `s1` and `s2`, then copy the `largeStr` only once.

When all strings concatenated are compile-time constants, Firefox automatically merges them at compile time:

```js
function folding() {
    var str = 'compile' + 'time' + 'folding';
    str += 'this' + 'works' + 'too';
    str = str + 'but' + 'not' + 'this';
}

console.log(foldingDemo.toString());
/** =>
 * function folding() {
 * 		var str = 'compiletimefolding';
 * 		str = 'thisworkstoo';
 * 		str = str + 'but' + 'not' + 'this';
 * }
 */
```

Since we have not often built strings from compile-time constants, it doesn't help very often at all.
