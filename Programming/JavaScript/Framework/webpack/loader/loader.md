### Lists of Loaders

val: Executes code as module and consider exports as JavaScript code
to-string: Executes code as a module, casts output to a string and exports it
imports: Imports stuff to the module
exports: Exports stuff from the module
expose: Expose exports from a module to the global context
script: Executes a JavaScript file once in global context (like in script tag), requires are not parsed.
apply: Executes a exported JavaScript function, optionally with arguments, and exports its return value.
callback: Parses your JS, calls specified functions (which you implement in webpack context) and replaces them with the results
if-loader: This is a preprocesser for the webpack module bundler. It support the if directive,similar to C #ifdef .
ifdef-loader: Preprocessor for .js/.ts files that allows conditional compilation via // #if and // #endif, while preserving sourcemaps.
