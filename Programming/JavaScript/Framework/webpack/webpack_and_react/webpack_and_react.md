## Webpack + React [Back](./../webpack.md)

For my familiarity, I'll build up with react projects with the following file structure:

> project

>> src

>>> components

>>> *_entry.js

>> build

> *.html

Files of sites like (`*.html`) will be placed in the root of this project or if using Laravel, the place will be other one outside this project.
