## Animation [Back](./../add_on.md)

React provides a `ReactTransitionGroup` add-on component as a low-level API for animation, and a `ReactCSSTransitionGroup` for easily implementing basic CSS animations and transitions.

### High-level API: `ReactCSSTransitionGroup`

`ReactCSSTransitionGroup` is based on `ReactTransitionGroup` and is an easy way to perform CSS transitions and animations when a React component enters or leaves the DOM. It's inspired by the excellent ng-animate library.
