React Router is a complete routing library of React, which is isolated from Redux.

**React Router keeps your UI in sync with the UR**L. It has a simple API with powerful features like **lazy code loading**, **dynamic route matching**, and location transition handling built right in. Make the URL your first thought, not an after-thought.
