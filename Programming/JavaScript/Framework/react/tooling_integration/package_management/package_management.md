### CDN-hosted React

We provide CDN-hosted versions of React [on our download page](https://facebook.github.io/react/downloads.html). These pre-built files use the UMD module format. Dropping them in with a simple `<script>` tag will inject the `React` and `ReactDOM` globals into your environment. It should also work out-of-the-box in CommonJS and AMD environments.
