### ES2015 with JSX

#### In-browser JSX Transform

If you like using JSX, Babel 5 provided an in-browser ES2015 and JSX transformer for development called browser.js that can be included from [CDNJS](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/babel-core/5.8.34).

With that JavaScript file, we can just include a `<script type="text/babel">` tag o engage the JSX transformer.
