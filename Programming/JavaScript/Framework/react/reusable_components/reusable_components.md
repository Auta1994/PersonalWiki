## Reusable Components [Back](./../react.md)

Reusable Components with well-designed interfaces mean that the next time you need to build some UIs, and you can write much less code, with **faster development time, fewer bugs, and fewer bytes**.

### Prop Validation

`React.PropTypes` exports a range of validators that can be used to make sure the data you receive is valid. When an invalid value is provided for a prop, a warning will be shown in the JavaScript console. 

*Note that for performance reasons propTypes is only checked in development mode.*
