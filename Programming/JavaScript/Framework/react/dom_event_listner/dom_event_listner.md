## DOM Event Listeners in a Component [Back](./../react.md)

> **Note:**

> This entry shows how to attach DOM events not provided by React. This is good for integrations with other libraries such as jQuery.

Try to resize the window:

{%ace edit=false, lang='jsx', theme='tomorrow'%}
var Box = React.createClass({
    
});
{%endace%}
