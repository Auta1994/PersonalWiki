## Use `void 0` rather than `undefined` [Back](./../underscore.md)

If you look through the whole source code, you'll never find any `undefiend` object, but only one string `"undefined"`, why?

Firstly, `undefined` is not a reversed word, and it's only a attribute of all global objects, which can be override in low edition of IE.
