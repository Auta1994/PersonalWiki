Sometimes, data will have a hierarchy, such as files in a file system, and for this kind of data, we will import trees to store them.

### Trees Defined

A tree is made up of a set of **nodes** connected by **edges**. An example of a tree is a company's organizational chart (*Figure 1*), in which each box is a **node**, and the lines between two boxes are called **edges**.

The top node of a tree is called the **root** node. If a node is connected t other nodes below it, the preceding node is called the **parent** node, while the following one is called the **child** node.
