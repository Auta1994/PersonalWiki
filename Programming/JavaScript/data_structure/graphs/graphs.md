## Graphs [Back](./../data_structure.md)

The study of networks has become one of the great scientific hotbeds (熱點) of this century, though mathematicians and others have been studying networks for many hundreds of years.

In this chapter, we'll look at how networks are modeled with graphs in JavaScript.

### Graphs Definitions

A graph consists of a set of **vertices** (頂點) and **edges**, which mainly consists of two kinds: A **digrapth** (directed graph) and an **unordered graph**.

A graph whose pairs are ordered is called a directed graph (*Figure 1*), or just a digraph.

A graph, which is not ordered, is called an unordered graph (*Figure 2*), or just a graph.
