## GLSL [Back](./../webgl.md)

**GLSL**, a.k.a OpenGL Shading Language, is a high-level shading (著色) language based on the syntax of the C programming language. It was created to give developers more direct controls of the graphics pipeline without having to use ARB assembly language, or hardware-specific languages.
