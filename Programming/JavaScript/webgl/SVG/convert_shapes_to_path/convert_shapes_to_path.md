## Convert all shapes/primitives into path element of SVG [Back](./../SVG.md)

In SVG, shapes/primitives are defined with different elements like `circle`, `ellipse`, `line`, `polygon`, `polyline`, `rect`, and so on. If I want to draw them with [this tutorial](./../../canvas/drawing_a_svg/drawing_a_svg.md), I need to convert all of them into a same element, `path`. How? This is the purpose of this document.
