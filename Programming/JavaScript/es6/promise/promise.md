## Promise [Back](./../es6.md)

Promise is used for asynchronous calculating, which is an object which means that it will be done in the future.

```js
var promiseObj = new Promise(function (resolve, reject)) {
    /** calling resolve when the job is done */
    resolve();
    
    /** calling
};
```
