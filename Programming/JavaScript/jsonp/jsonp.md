## JSONP [Back](./../JavaScript.md)

**JSONP**, also named **JSON with padding** or **JSON-P**, which is a JSON extension used by web developers to overcome the cross-domain restrictions with `<script>`. `<script>` is used to load JavaScript from a URL, and use a JavaScript engine to parse, rather than a JSON engine.

```html
<script type="text/javascript"></script>
```
