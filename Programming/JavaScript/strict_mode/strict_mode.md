## Strict Mode [Back](./../JavaScript.md)

Strict Mode(嚴格模式) is a way in ES5 to *opt in* to a restricted variant of JavaScript.

Browsers not supporting strict mode will run strict mode code with different behavior from browsers that do, so don't rely on strict mode without feature-testing for support for the relevant aspects of strict mode
