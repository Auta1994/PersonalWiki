## Markup and Data Formats [Back](./../regular.md)

This chapter mainly covers some regular expressions about markup languages and some data formats: HTML, XHTML, XML, CSV, and INI. However some of these formats can be surprisingly complex to process and manipulate accurately, at least using regular expressions.

### Basic rules for formats covered in this chapter

#### Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)

HTML is used to describe the structure, semantics, and appearances of billions of web pages and other documents. In this chapter, we'll only concentrate on the rule needed to process the key components of well-formed HTML: **elements (and the attributes they contain)**, **character references**, **comments**, and **document type declarations**.

#### Extensible Hypertext Markup Language (XHTML)

XHTML is designed as successor (接替者) to HTML 4.01, and migrated HTML from its SGML heritage (遺產) to an XML foundation.
