## Regular Expressions [Back](./../JavaScript.md)

In the context of this book, a `regular expression` is a specific text pattern that you can use with many modern applications and programming languages.

> #### History of the Term "Regular Expression"

> The term `regular expression` comes from mathematics and computer science theory, where it reflects a trait (特點) of mathematical expressions called `regularity`.

> All a practical programmer needs to remember is that some ivory tower (象牙塔) computer scientists get upset about their well-defined terminology being overloaded with technology that's far more useful in the real world.

With the proper regular expression, it takes just a few line of code, or maybe even one line, to extract something we want in a large text body. However, even if it's convenient, you are not supposed to abuse them where they're not really appropriate.
